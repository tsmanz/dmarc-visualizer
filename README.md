# dmarc-visualizer

Analyse and visualize DMARC results using open-source tools.

* [parsedmarc](https://github.com/domainaware/parsedmarc) for parsing DMARC reports,
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) to store aggregated data.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize the aggregated reports.

I have combined parts two github repos to make something that works for me so I can't take any credit.
